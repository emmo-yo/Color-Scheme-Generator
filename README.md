# Color Scheme Generator solo project
This is my solution to [Scrimbas](https://scrimba.com/allcourses) solo project challange. No solutions are provided by Scrimba for solo projects. For this solution, I added a toggle button for light and dark mode using Font Awesome icons. When clicking on the colors or hex code, the rgb code or hex code will be copied to clipboard, respectively.
